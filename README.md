# factoryFunctions

This is a resource first and foremost for myself through which to practice factory functions. It is also a way to collect the references I stumble across pertaining to them. A list of references is included at the bottom of this Readme.

## Notes

## Exercises

**Lightning Exercise 1:** Write a factory function that creates an object that represents a doctor. The function should accept three arguments.
>
>    1. Doctor's name
>    1. Specialty _(Oncologist, pediatrician, etc...)_
>    1. Address of practice


> **Lightning Exercise 2:** Write a factory function that creates an object that represents a pet. The function should accept two arguments.
>
>    1. Pet name
>    1. Pet breed
>
> Invoke the factory function 3 times and place each animal in an array stored in a variable named `BowWowKennels`

## Practice: Music Row

Your job is to sign each of these promising young music stars to the appropriate label.

* JumpStop Records works with Funk and Rap artists.
* Chatten Records works with Country and Bluegrass artists.
* Polar Records works with Pop artists.

Create an array for each of these record labels.

Create a factory function for each possible genre (_e.g. `createBluegrassArtist()`_). Then invoke the appropriate function for each of the following artists and place the resulting object in the corresponding label array.

* Bruce Atikins is a Country artist and is 23 years old
* Jensen Brown is a Pop artist and is 20 years old
* Dre Funkz is a Funk artist and is 25 years old
* Dusta Grimes is a Rap artist and is 21 years old
* Bartholomew Danielson is a Bluegrass artist and is 23 years old
* Avilee Dallas is a Country artist and is 19 years old
* Austin Kinkaid is a Pop artist and is 22 years old
* Loyonc√© Branis is a Rap artist and is 27 years old
